  <h1>RoBATS's changelog file</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--Sorry for bad html lmao, I'm not that good of a web developer -->
      <h3>What is this file?</h3>
          <p>It is a markdown file you can view with your browser. Don't worry, this is just markdown, it's not like I can IP grab you with this or send nuclear missiles to your house.</p>
  
          <p>This file is the changelog for the RoBATS project, including ideas, future plans, and mainly logging changes made over time. Use the -changelog command to get a copy of this file sent to you, which you can then use to view any recent changes made to the bot and the project itself.</p>
      <h3>Future ambitions for the project</h3>
          <p>Since not many people use this bot anyway, and it is only being maintained because I feel like it, I don't see much of a future for the project. I plan on open sourcing the bot, maybe one of you will fork it, or use some of the concepts implemented in the bot on your own projects, maybe someone outside of the server will find it, I really don't know.</p>
      <h3>Licensing</h3>
          <p>I am still deciding what type of license I'll be adding to the codebase when it becomes open. Whatever license it is, please respect it. I'm not going to sue anyone over it, but the license is there for a reason.</p>
      <h3>To do:</h3>
          <ul>
	    <li>Update the AI module</li>
	    <li>Add and improve image conversion</li>
	    <li>Choose a license for the project</li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
