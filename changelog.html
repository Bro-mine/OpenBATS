  <h1>RoBATS's changelog file</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--Sorry for bad html lmao, I'm not that good of a web developer -->
      <h3>What is this file?</h3>
          <p>It is a markdown file you can view with your browser. Don't worry, this is just markdown, it's not like I can IP grab you with this or send nuclear missiles to your house.</p>
  
          <p>This file is the changelog for the RoBATS project, including ideas, future plans, and mainly logging changes made over time. Use the -changelog command to get a copy of this file sent to you, which you can then use to view any recent changes made to the bot and the project itself.</p>
      <h3>Future ambitions for the project</h3>
          <p>Since not many people use this bot anyway, and it is only being maintained because I feel like it, I don't see much of a future for the project. The bot has been open sourced because of this, and maybe one of you will fork it, or use some of the concepts implemented in the bot on your own projects, maybe someone outside of the server will find it, I really don't know.</p>
      <h3>Licensing</h3>
          <p>RoBATS is now licensed with the GPL-3.0 license, that means you cannot use this software for closed source projects. I won't complain if it is done with local, private projects, but if you intend to use this to make public discord bots, or any other piece of software, you must disclose the source. I won't sue anyone over this license, but again, it is here for a reason, please, respect it.</p>
